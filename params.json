{"name":"Imgless","tagline":"An angular JS application that ties into your current project to make it img-less.","body":"# Imgless\r\n\r\nAn Angular JS application to tie into your current app, which allows you to use imgless tags instead of img tags.\r\n\r\nAll <imgless> tags are converted to data URI and stored within the images.json file.  Images that are already stored, are served from the json file (almost) instantly.  **This also allows you to serve images without actually needing the image on your server**.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAdd angular and the app.js to your project.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/app.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttach the app where needed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body ng-app=\"imgLess\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse imgless tags.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<imgless src=\"img/toby.jpg\" id=\"toby\" class=\"toby\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI have included all files from the project in which this was created.  It's pretty straightforward, and you can see the implementation in index.html.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Kalan Brock\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
